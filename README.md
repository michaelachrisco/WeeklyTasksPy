Scripting out Weekly Tasks

Every week, an email must be sent with weekly tasks. Since I have to do this to multiple teams and multiple managers, it makes sense to automate it! 

Technlogies:
1. Python 3.6
2. Selenium
3. Sendgrid

The script is based off of:
* git standup
* Prior script for Youtrack from a past job

What it looks like (now, planning on changes):

```
python weekly_tasks.py

Emails sent:

manager@totallyrealcompany.com

Things I worked on this week:
1. Task from last week
2. Task #2 from last week

Things I plan on working on next week:
1. Task #1 that will be done
2. Task #2 that will be done

Blockers:
1. Super hard thing #1
2. Super hard thing #1

```

Email is based off the common 3 questions for standups.
